<p>I joined the team to do a complete rewrite of our backend system using Clojure, ElasticSearch, and Cassandra stack. The new backend offers much more flexibility, high performant and includes a complex access control rules. Our team is also in charge of the operational side of the system, so I learned about deployment using Ansible, metrics collection (what to collect and how to read them) with Graphite and Grafana, performed operational tasks (track down issues, understand why we are getting exceptions, etc)</p>

<p>On top of that, I also work on the frontend side using Ember.js - this includes working with a new set of features and bugfixes. I was involved in helping out with massive Ember.js upgrade (1.10 to 2.x) by rewriting all tests and making sure that the system still works as expected. </p>

<p>I also involved in developing our main mobile-first responsive website using a CMS system with Bootstrap and jQuery. I coordinated with various team from Marketing and Analytics team to provide feedback on best practice for the website (UX, performance, etc)</p>`

<p>Krux’s next-gen DMP helps businesses drive revenue by unifying, analyzing and activating people data for personalized content, commerce and advertising experiences. Krux is the new system of engagement that empowers marketers, agencies and publishers to reach the right audience, at the right time and at the right frequency across all devices, browsers and operating systems. Krux’s technology is defined and informed by the principle of People Data Activation, comprising six capabilities: Governance, Completeness, Plasticity, Synthesis, Identity and Actionability. Krux reaches over 2 billion devices worldwide, serves 20+ billion page views and processes more than 1.5 billion CRM records per month.</p>

<p>I deal with Python, Django, Tastypie, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, Sass, Node, Java, Chrome Remote Debugging Interface, a bit of Puppet and some AWS stuff (SQS, S3, EMR, Redshift, RDS)</p>

<p>I'm involved with the upgrade of the Browser Emulator Service (both frontend and backend). In the backend, a Java application is running Google Chrome to emulate sites. Using Chromium Remote Debugging Interface, we process HAR file that is generated by the browser and also inject custom JavaScript tag to process additional informations before storing the result in RDS and Redshift. The service relies heavily on SQS and S3</p>`
