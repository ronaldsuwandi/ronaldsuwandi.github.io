        Built a rapid prototype integrating Stockfish with LLM-generated explanations to analyze chess moves, aiming
        to bridge the gap between engine calculations and human reasoning. Found key AI limitations—LLMs often
        misinterpret board states and struggle with structured logic, leading to subtle hallucinations and
        explanations. Recently refined by adding FEN for better context and testing a game review feature to improve
        output quality. Tested GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, with GPT-4o performing better but still unreliable. Completed
        as a proof-of-concept with no plans for further development
