[Leap Touch 2.0][lt] is now available for [Chrome] and [Safari], with Firefox and Opera versions submitted and waiting for approval from their extension stores. [Leap Touch 2.0][lt] comes with new simpler gestures, better cursor and help screen -- check out its official [blog post][] for more details.

My main two takeaways after working with Firefox extensions

1. Documentation is extremely critical. Not only the content must be excellent, content ease of access is just as important (e.g. it's one thing to have a great documentation on function X, but how easy to find the documentation about it is just as important; how does function Y relate to function X. One must create a great howto / tutorial that has reference to function X)

2. It's very tempting to take a shortcut and sacrifice quality just because that's the easiest path (or perhaps the only path at that time). Don't. Poke around longer, the right path might be just hidden somewhere.
