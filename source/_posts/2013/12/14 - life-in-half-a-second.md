I have recently read [Life in Half a Second][lihas] written by [Matthew Michalewicz][mm]. All I can say is that this book is a must to read.

Simply saying that the book is inspiring, challenging and motivational doesn't do justice. Have a read at the [first chapter (PDF)][free] and you will understand what I mean :)

You can purchase the book from [Amazon][amazon]

PS - I attended the book launch in Sydney last month and it was simply amazing. Great performance by [Vinh Giang][vinh] and excellent introduction to the book by [Matthew Michalewicz][mm]. If you ever need an inspiring speaker/entertainer/magician, you should definitely check them out.
