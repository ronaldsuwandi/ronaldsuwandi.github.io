I have to admit I have been lazy keeping up with my journal. However, I decided that I will continue to write journal once again after watching [Clannad][clannad]. Embarrassing to admit but that anime had such a huge emotional impact. Spoiler alert - <spoiler>When Okazaki lost Nagisa, one thing that stuck in my head was that he keeps remembering their memories together; it’s such a heart wrenching scene.</spoiler>

Suddenly another thought came into my head; this time from [Game of Thrones][got]. King Robert once said to Ned Stark that he loves Ned’s deceased sister. But the tragedy is that it’s been so long that he can’t even remember what does she look like.

At that moment I realised that I must continue to write journal, I want to write all the memories that I have with Stephanie while I still have the chance. There is only so much memories your brain can handle before it starts to give way. Before that happens, at least I want all my memories written down in a journal where I can read it again in the future

Also another reason is based on [Matthew Michalewicz’][mm] book - [Life in Half a Second][lihas] (get it on [Amazon][amazon]). One of the important tip is to keep a journal; keep track how does my daily/weekly routine helps me to reach my goals.
