### About

[Leap Touch][lt] is a browser extension that allows you to control browsing with a [Leap Motion][lm] device.

We held a [Leap Motion][lm] hack day at [Fishburners][] on August 18th 2013 to see what we could make. A bunch of ideas were tried, including virtual face interaction, 3D marionette control (with Oculus Rift), and underwater obstacle detection, but our browser control plugin seemed useful enough to push forward and make available.

A week later and we were ready to ship, and share a celebratory sandwich.

We’ve tried to keep the gestures as simple as possible, without a complex interface for people to understand. This is aimed at occasional use, not constant use, which we think is better for this device.

Don’t have a touchscreen on your PC, Mac or Chromebook? No problem. You can still add a Leap Motion gesture device to your Chrome browsing experience. You’ll just need to install this Chrome extension and you’re good to go: Pinch, zoom and scroll around the web without touching a screen, keyboard or mouse.

When mobile phones went from keypads to touch, people were crazy about them- they just wanted a touch-phone. It was a revolution almost in the mobile industry. Leap Touch can be regarded to be standing on the edge of such a revolution.
